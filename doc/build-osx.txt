See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building NavCoin QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.10, 10.11, 10.12 intel.
PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

1) Install Xcode using the App Store:

	- CMD + <space>
	- Type 'App Store'
	- Type 'Xcode' in Search field.
	- Click 'Install'.

(*) The next steps of the installation process must be run on the Terminal.
    Press 'CMD + <space>' and type 'Terminal' to launch it.

2) Install command line tools.

	xcode-select --install

   Note: If you see the following text, then the Xcode command line tools are
         already installed.

	xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use
	"Software Update" to install update

   Click Install and accept the Command Line Tools License Agreement.

   The Xcode Command Line Tools will then be installed on your system.

3) Clone the github tree to get the source code:

	git clone http://www.github.com/navcoindev/navcoin2

4) Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

5) Install dependencies from MacPorts

	sudo /opt/local/bin/port install boost db48 openssl miniupnpc gcc5

6) Now you should be able to build navcoind:

	cd navcoin/src
	make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./navcoind --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./navcoind -daemon # to start the navcoin daemon.
Run
  ./navcoind help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands

7) If you have problems with secp256k1 library, you can manually compile it using these steps:

cd src
curl "http://navcoin.org/files/secp.zip" -o "secp.zip"
unzip secp.zip

cd secp256k1
sudo chmod 777 *
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-module-recovery
make

Then try step 6 again.
